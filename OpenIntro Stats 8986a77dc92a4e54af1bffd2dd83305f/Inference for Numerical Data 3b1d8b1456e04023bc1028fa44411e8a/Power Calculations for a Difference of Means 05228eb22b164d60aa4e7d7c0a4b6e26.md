# Power Calculations for a Difference of Means

You want to collect enough data to detect important effects but do it as cheap as possible.

So what is an appropriate sample size where we can be X% sure we could detect any important effects? 

1. What values between two sample means of two groups would we have to reject the null hypothesis?
This gives a rejection region. The value is called the minimum effect size of interest

This probability is called the power, and we can compute it for different sample sizes or for different effect sizes. aka the probability that this no. of people will be large enough to show an effect

TODO: Do a better job at this... i can't make sense of it
