# Difference between 2 means

Difference between two population means u1 and u2 under the condition is not paired.

1. Identify conditions to ensure you can use t-distribution with a point estimate of the difference x1 - x2 and a new SE formula.

**Prepare**. 

Retrieve critical contextual information, and if appropriate, set up hypotheses.

- Hypothesis are related to two groups

**Check**. 

Ensure the required conditions are reasonably satisfied.
**Calculate**. 

Find the standard error, and then construct a confidence interval, or if conducting a hypothesis test, find a test statistic and p-value.
**Conclude**. 

Interpret the results in the context of the application.

If the 2 populations have SDs so similar, use a pooled standard deviation:

A pooled standard deviation is only appropriate when background research indicates the population standard deviations are nearly equal. When the sample size is large and the condition may be adequately checked with data, the benefits of pooling the standard deviations greatly diminishes.
