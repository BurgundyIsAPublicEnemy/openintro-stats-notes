T values measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in sample data. It is basically the calculated difference represented in units of standard error.

- If t value is greater, there is evidence of a significant difference.
- If t-value is closer to ***0,*** there are chances of no significant difference.

The critical T value is the point where it's either significantly difference or none

It's the cut off value of the region where you reject / accept the null
