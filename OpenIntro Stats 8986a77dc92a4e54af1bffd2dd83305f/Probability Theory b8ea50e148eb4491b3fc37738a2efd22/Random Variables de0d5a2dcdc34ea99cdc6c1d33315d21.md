# Random Variables

**Random Variables**

It’s often useful to model a process using what’s called a random variable: a random process or variable with a numerical outcome.

The average outcome of the random variable is Expected Value

Variability is volatility of variable's outcome

A simpler version is: 

$S^2 = (\sum (x_i - x_{mean}) ^ 2 )/ (n-1)$

Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its population mean or sample mean, showing how far a set of numbers is spread from their average value.

S is Standard Deviation: **a** **measure of how dispersed the data is in relation to the mean**

**Linear combinations of random variables**

Use a table like this to work out S.D / Variance / Expected

Where y is an outcome of the variable

**Variability of Linear Combinations of Random Variables**

Used in stocks, to measure fluctuations of random variables.

Always remember —> uncertainty is standard deviation, which is taking the square root of variance

**Continuous distributions**

If you try take a probability distribution histogram, the bins will be v small, so smooth it out

This smooth curve represents a probability density function (also called a density or
distribution)

Total area adds to 1

So, basically, you split it out like: 

Where n (as in n terms) 

$n * ((var(x1) / n^2) + (var(x2) / n^2) + ... + (var(x_n) / n^2))$

and it becomes $σ^2 / n$
