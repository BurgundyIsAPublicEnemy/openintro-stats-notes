# Outliers in Linear Regression

- (Think this of raw distance from everything else) High leverage → points that fall horizontally away from the centre o the cloud pull harder on the line
- Influential point → points which have an influence on the slope of the line
    - If you remove an influential point, the fit changes
    - If point is in the centre of the data, less likely to have an impact
    

You cave have outliers which are both.

Don't remove outliers as they're important.
