# Testing for independence in 2 way tables

A two-way table describes counts for combinations of outcomes for two variables

Hypothesis should test whether there is a statistically significant evidence that variables are independent 

I and J come from the row you are testing

For two way tables, the degrees of freedom is equal to df = (number of rows minus 1) × (number of columns minus 1) aka

**df = (R − 1) × (C − 1)**
