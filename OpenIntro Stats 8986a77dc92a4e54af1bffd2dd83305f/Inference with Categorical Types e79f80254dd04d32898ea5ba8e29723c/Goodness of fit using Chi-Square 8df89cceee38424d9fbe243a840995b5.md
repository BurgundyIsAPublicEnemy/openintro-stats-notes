# Goodness of fit using Chi-Square

[https://www.simplypsychology.org/chi-square.html](https://www.simplypsychology.org/chi-square.html)

Used when data is binned:

- Given a sample of cases that can be classified into several groups, determine if sample is representative of general population
- Evaluate whether data resembles a particular distribution

1. Create a test statistic for one way tables.
    1. Create two hypotheses as normal (null and alternative) concerning sample
2. Consider the following test statistic:

- Made by identifying the difference between a point estimate and the expected value if the null hypothesis is true
- Point estimate can be the observed count,
- Standardizing the difference using the Standard Error of point estimate.

3. This gives a Z score. You do this for every bin, square them, and add them up.

- This makes standardized differences positive
- Unusual differences are smaller.

4. This is referred to $X^2$

Follows a Chi-Square distribution.

- Right skew
- Always positive
- One parameter: degree of freedom (controls shape, centre, spread of distribution)

Finding the area in the tail of the distribution gives p-value.

If P1 = P2, then follows Chi distribution

- If table has just two bins, pick a single bin, use one-proportion method'
