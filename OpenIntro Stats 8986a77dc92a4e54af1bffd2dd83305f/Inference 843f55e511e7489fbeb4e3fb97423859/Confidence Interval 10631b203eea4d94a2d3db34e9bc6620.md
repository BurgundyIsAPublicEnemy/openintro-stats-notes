# Confidence Interval

The sample proportion p-hat provides a single plausible value for population proportion p.

When the sample proportion isn't perfect and there is some standard error, provide a plausible range of values for an estimate of the population proportion instead of the point estimate.

If our sample proportion p-hat is the most plausible value of the population proportion, makes sense to build a confidence interval around the point estimate.

SE provides a guide for how large it should be as it represents the standard deviation of the point estimate.

**If CTL is satisfied, the point estimate follows a normal distribution and so...** 

A confidence interval which extends 1.96 standard errors from the sample proportion will be 95% confident the interval captures the population proportion

99% is +- 2.58 SEs 

- To be more confident about capturing the parameter, we need a wider interval

This approach uses Z-scores in the normal model to computer confidence levels only.

- Margin of error is z* x SE
