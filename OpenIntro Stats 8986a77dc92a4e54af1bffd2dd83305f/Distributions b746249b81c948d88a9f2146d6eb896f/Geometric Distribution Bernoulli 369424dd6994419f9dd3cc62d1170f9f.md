# Geometric Distribution / Bernoulli

Used for figuring how long should we expect to flip a coin until it turns up heads? Or how many times should we expect to roll a die until we get a 1?

Note:

- Cards dealt in poker are not bernoulli because the cards dealt are not independent - if you get a Jack of hearts, the next card you get cant be a jack of hearts
- Outcome of dice is not Bernoulli because only two outcomes can be bernoulli

First formalize each trial – such as a single coin flip or die toss – using the Bernoulli
distribution, and then we combine these with our tools from probability

The geometric distribution is used to describe how many trials it takes to observe a success.

- This is independent and identically distributed
- In general, probabilities for geometric distributions decrease exponentially fast

## Bernoulli Random Variable

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial)

- Each "event" is a trial.
- You can label trials i.e. success or failure
- Work out the probability of an event i.e. probability of being successful is 0.7
- When individual trial only has 2 possible outcomes, Bernoulli is used.
- 1 is success, 0 is failure

As 0 and 1 are numerical outcomes, you can calculate mean and standard deviations of a random variable
