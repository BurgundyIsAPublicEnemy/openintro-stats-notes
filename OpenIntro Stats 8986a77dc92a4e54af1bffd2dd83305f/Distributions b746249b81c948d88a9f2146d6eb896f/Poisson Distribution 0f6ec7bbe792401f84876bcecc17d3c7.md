# Poisson Distribution

Estimate no. of events in a large population over time such as having a heart attack or winning the lottery.

- Describe events that will occur in a day for a fixed population if the individuals within population are independent
- Rate → average number of occurrences in mostly fixed population per unit of time
- The parameter here is λ which means rate

**Conditions:**

- Random variable may follow a Poisson distribution if we are looking for the number of events, the population that generates such events is large, and the events occur independently of each other
    - Works even if events are not independent
